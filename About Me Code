About Us - We are VJ Customs run by both Vrishab Madduri and Jordon Kashanchi. We started as two high school students with a dream to sell custom car parts
at extremely high prices. We strive to give our customers high-quality parts at double the cost! We grew from a small business to a huge multi-million 
dollar corporation exporting to 197 different countries. We plan to use the money we have earned to buy big houses and fast cars. Thanks
for doing business with us!
